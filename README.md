Background:
A project about employees at a company during the 1980s and 1990s using six CSV files.

I designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data. In other words, I performed the following:
  1. Data Modeling
  2. Data Engineering
  3. Data Analysis

Data Modeling/Data Engineering:
